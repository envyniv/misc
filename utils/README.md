# [godot-unpacker by tehskai](https://github.com/tehskai/godot-unpacker)
godot archive unpacker for non-encrypted files

## system requirements
* python 3 (tested on Python 3.6.5 (v3.6.5:f59c0932b4, Mar 28 2018, 16:07:46) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32)

## usage
move .pck or .exe (if game itself is a large exe file) file in the same directory as script and run:
```
python godot-unpacker.py data.pck
```
or
```
python godot-unpacker.py your_godot_game.exe
```
extracted game files should be in "output" directory.
## converting textures
unpacker will convert .tex texture files into corresponding image format (webp, png or jpg) automatically. if you want .tex files to remain intact change this variable:
```
rip_textures = True
```
to False.

it's just a stupid script. (that doesn't even work properly)
